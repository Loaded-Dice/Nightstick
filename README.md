# Nightstick
 
 Artistic LED toy - POV display style animated LEDs Arduino based code and DIY tutorial
 
 The main idea is to track the movement of the stick with an IMU (inertial measurement unit) 
 and display static images while the Nightstick is rotating
 
 This is not my first project, but the first one I publish on GitHub.
 
 Any tips, contributions or improvements are welcome.
 
 I'm still figuring things out :)
